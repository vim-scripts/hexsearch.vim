This is a preprocessor to Vim's search command.
It converts a sequence of hex numbers into a usual search pattern
(one char per hex-code).  Searching is literal.

Example:
    :HexSearch 56696d 20 72756c657a21
finds ... you know.

If 'fileformat' is unix or mac, there is (almost) no difference to searching
for a hex string in a hex-editor.

Here is the "almost" case for 'ff=unix':
    :HexSearch 0A
finds a linebreak at the end of the file, even if there isn't one.

See inside script for more details.
